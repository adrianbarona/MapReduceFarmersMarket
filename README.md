# MapReduceFarmersMarket
Updated Farmer's Market


The .java files contained in these folders are codes that I updated.

The code was originally in an older version of Hadoop.

I also added a partition class that organizes the outputs into specific criterias (more detailed comments in actual code).

In addition to that, I edited the reduce class so that it doesn't produce junk data.


All, original, unedited code can be found here: https://github.com/arron-green/hadoop-city-farmers-market-example
